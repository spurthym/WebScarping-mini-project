# WebScarping-mini-project
Using the BeautifulSoup api and python a mini project is done to scrape the web
•The website from which the content is scraped and stored in a csv file is https://collegedunia.com/courses/courses-after-12th
•My main objective was to enlist all the courses available after 12 and also extract their links
